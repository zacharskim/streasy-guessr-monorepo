This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Random Todos

find new font system etc
settle on component stuff...shadcn/ui ??
settle on final mockup of ui...
figure out the map library ??? also the picture display ...
determine way to filter the images so there are no 'duds'

should the user get dropped to street view? or is that too easy given like the manhattan grid,,, maybe they just don't get to move around? and then they can toggle into the images maybe??

how would this look on mobile?? future branch perhaps...
